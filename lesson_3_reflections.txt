local?

- To work on more than one machine
- to collaborate
- for safety

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- to not interfere with work and deal with unnecessary merges.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

- forks are clones entirely on github sometimes between two github accounts
- clones are copies of repositories. sometimes on differnet servers (local versus remote)
- branches are labels on particular commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

- having a local copy of the last know state allows for efficient merging.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

- don't really inderstand what I am supposed to be thinking about here.
- I would collborate using shared contributors and forking.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
